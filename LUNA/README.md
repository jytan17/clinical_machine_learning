This project is split into three parts
1. Segmentation Model that takes a whole CT scan as input and "marks" voxels that are likely to be nodules
2. Nodule Classification Model that classifies nodules (output of 1)
3. Malignancy Classification Model that takes each nodule (output of 2)


- I completed this project with the guidance of the book [Deep Learning with Pytorch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-PyTorch-Eli-Stevens/dp/1617295264/ref=asc_df_1617295264/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459709175715&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10076550352694943681&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033151&hvtargid=pla-671088923695&psc=1) (it is also available for free online)
